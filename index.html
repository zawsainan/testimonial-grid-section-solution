            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny&#39;s worth.
          </h3>
            <p>&ldquo; I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I&#39;ve been looking to make a 
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
            the course, I&#39;ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. &rdquo;</p>

           <p>&ldquo; I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer 
            for a big company. This was one of the best investments I&#39;ve made in myself. &rdquo;</p>

            <h3>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
              learning from their experiences was easy.</h3>
            <p>&ldquo; The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
            gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
            an incredible community of smart and amazing people. &rdquo;</p>

     <h3>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
     <p>&ldquo; Before joining the bootcamp, I&#39;ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
        could ever have. In fact, I&#39;ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
        100% recommend! &rdquo;</p>
